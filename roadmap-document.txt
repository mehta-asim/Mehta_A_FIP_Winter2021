HTML
1. Create icons which show information on hover
2. Create 2 button setup in which clicking a button will bring up relevant information and hide the information retrieved by the other button.
3. Create social media buttons which will change color when hovered on

CSS
Style the icons and button to match with the color tone of the website
set the base container vlaues for the button section to display:none

JS
1=>
	create variable to hold the icons
	create a 2-dimensional array to hold the information
	fire an event listener with a mouseenter event and call the function to show the information
	create a function to get the container id and initate variables to get hold of the child elements that need to be populated with the information
	next using the variables and the container id and array populate the container with information

	also fire an event listener with a mouseleave event and call another function so that the information should go away when hover over is off
	this function will reset the child element values to none/empty


2=>

	create variables for the buttons and for the sections that need to be visible when they are clicked
	add an event listener of click and call a function when either of the buttons are clicked
	the function will be responsible for changing the display style property from none(base css property for the specific section will already be set to display:none) to inline
	the function will also be responsible for chaning the display style property of the other section to none so at a time only the clicked button section is viewable

	repeat the event listener and function for the 2nd button as well

3=>

	create variable to hold all icons
	add an event listener of mouseenter event and call the function to change the src of image and thereby change the color
	
	also add an event listener of mouseleave event and call function to reset the src of image to original one
